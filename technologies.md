# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python. We have chosen Pandas for its versatility & cross-platform functionality.

## Database Storage
Postgres will be our database storage solution. Tentatively, we are exploring using Heroku for deployment.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We'll be breaking down the data into clusters to see if there are commonalities between the various medal winners. We're exploring random forests as a potential candidate.

## Dashboard
We intend on using Tableau as our dashboard platform, and plan on using Tableau Stories for our presentation. It will be hosted on Heroku.
