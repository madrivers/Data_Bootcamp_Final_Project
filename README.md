# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

## Deliverable 1

### Team Details 
The team consists of 4 members: Stephenie Deming, Rafael Peterson, Jeff Peterman and Alex Rios.

### Communication Protocolshttps://github.com/madrivers/Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project/blob/main/technologies.md)

The chosen communication method will be primarily Slack for ongoing messages and Zoom for meetings either during classes or other times. In the unlikely event of an un-responsive teammate the group may resort to indivdual phone conversations. 
Communication of assignments and individual tasks are done during regular class time with check-ins throughout the week via Slack.

### Topic
The topic we will explore is the Olympics from 1896 to 2020. We selected the Olympics because the dataset was relatively stable, available and contained enough interesting aspects to motiveate the group.  

### Source Data
The source data will primarily come from Kaggle in the form of CSV files that we will clean and load into a PostGres Database that will be eventually hosted on Heroku or AWS.  

### Project Outline
The team will explore two main questions
  1.  Is there a "Home Court" advantage in the Olympics.  That is to say, does the hosting country typically outperform other countries in the medal count.
  2.  Do countries with a typically cold/warm weather climate perform better in the Winter or Summer Olympics.
  3.  Is there any correlation in criteria for different medal types?

### Visualizations
Tableau was loaded with various data points, in order to graphically show the distribution of medals (overall) by country and also show a time lapse of meedals by country durin the various games.  Visualization data can be seen at:

### Presentation
Google slides show data to date and a framework for the final presentation.  As work progresses these slides will be updated leading up the final presentation.
