# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

## Deliverable 1

### Team Details 
The team consists of 4 members: Stephenie Deming, Rafael Peterson, Jeff Peterman and Alex Rios.

### Topic
The topic we will explore is the Olympics from 1896 to 2020. We selected the Olympics because the dataset was relatively stable, available and contained enough interesting aspects to motivate the group.  

### Source Data
The source data will primarily come from Kaggle in the form of CSV files that we will clean and load into a PostGres Database that will be eventually hosted on Heroku or AWS.  

### Project Outline
The team will explore these main questions:
  1.  Is there a "Home Court" advantage in the Olympics.  That is to say, does the hosting country typically outperform other countries in the medal count.
  2.  Is there any correlation in criteria for different medal types?
  3.  The impact of budget, GDP and other economic metrics to outcomes at the olympics.

### Visualizations
Tableau was loaded with various data points, in order to graphically show the distribution of medals (overall) by country and also show a time lapse of meedals by country durin the various games.  Visualization data can be seen at:
