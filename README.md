# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

## Deliverable 1

### Team Details and Communication
The team consists of 4 members: Stephenie Deming, Rafael Peterson, Jeff Peterman and Alex Rios.
The chosen communication method will be primarily Slack for ongoing messages and Zoom for meetings either during classes or other times.

### Topic
The topic we will explore is the Olympics from 1896 to 2020. We selected the Olympics because the dataset was relatively stable, avaialbe and contained enough interesting aspects to motiveate the group.  The source data will primarily come from CSV files that we will clean and load into a PostGres Database that will be eventually hosted on Heroku.  The team will explore two main questions"
  1.  Is there a "Home Court" advantage in the Olympics.  That is to say, does the hosting country typically outperform other countries in the medal count.
  2.  Do countries with a typically cold/warm weather climate perform better in the Winter or Summer Olympics.
  3.  Is there any correlation in criteria for different medal types?
